Changes to Coding Challenge #69 in this sketch
This is a list of changes I made to the Coding Challenge #69 from the Coding
Train.

Changes:


- Altruism: Each Vehicle can see other Vehicles and may seek them out. When
encountering another Vehicle, a Vehicle may choose to share some of its health
(food) with that Vehicle. Both the distance at which a Vehicle can be seen and
the willingness to share food are integrated into the DNA of the Vehicles and
can evolve. The sharing can be onesided but it can also be two sided. If a
Vehicle chooses to share and the other one doesn't then one loses health and the
other gains. If both or neither share there is no net change. Vehicles also have
the ability to seek out other vehicles as they do food. This is also necessary
not only for Altruism but reproduction.

- Reproduction: Rather than vehicles being cloned periodically, they must now
have a mate in order to reproduce. The ability to see a potential mate is
encoded in the DNA using the same value as the ability to see Vehicles as
mentioned in the Altruism section. Meaning a Vehicle must enter another
Vehicle's perception radius for Vehicles to be considered for either mating or
Altruism. Due to the natural of reproduction, additional rules were imposed:

- A Vehicle cannot reproduce until it has been alive for some minimum number of
frames. This varies from about 3 to 10 seconds.

- Once a Vehicle reproduces, it cannot reproduce again for between 0 and 2
seconds. Both of these are to mitigate the out-of-control exponential growth
that occurs when two Vehicles are near each other and can reproduce. Vehicles
move apart seeking food or the like before they are capable of reproducing
again.

- The Chance for Reproduction Slider, indicates how likely it is that two
Vehicles will reproduce when they are near each other. Please note the
distinctions. All Vehicles have a Vehicle Perception radius like for food. They
cannot see and therefore cannot consider Vehicles outside this radius for either
Altruism or Mating. All Vehicles also have a part
of their DNA that indicates how strongly they are attracted to seeking another
Vehicle if they see one. In the same way that they have a part of their DNA that
indicates how attracted they are to food if they see it. (If this is confusing I
suggest watching the Coding Train videos to see what I mean). Finally,
regardless of if they seek the mate, if a Vehicle comes into their perception
radius, there is a chance they will reproduce. <strong>This</strong> is what is
determined by the slider for reproduction chance.


- When reproducing, the child Vehicle will receive some <strong>continuous
  percentage</strong> of either parent's DNA. It may be 50/50 or 100/0 or 20/80
etc. but the DNA taken from each parent will always be continuous. A child could
never for example inherit gene 1, 3, and 7 from one parent and 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9,
10 from another. This design choice like many was not done for correctness or
efficiency but simply as a creative choice. Anyone is encouraged to do this
differntly!

- Saving and Loading: It is possible to save and load the data in this sketch.
The sketch keeps track of the largest population created and the surviving
vehicle of that population. Any time the population size record is broken AND
the last vehicle of that population dies, the best Vehicle is updated and you
can save it as JSON. This cannot currently be loaded back into the program.
Furthermore, you can at any point save the configuration of the simulation. This
will save the environment variables (values of the three sliders) and the DNA
(and only the DNA) of all the living Vehicles in the world. This configuration
data (sort of like a snapshot) can be loaded back into the prgoram with the load
button. Notice that the sketch currently has an optimal configuration in a
folder. This configuration produces a stable and consistent population size that
will run for a long time (possibly indefintiely).

- Debug Output: The perception radius for other Vehicles and propensity to seek
them out are drawn like the Food and Poison values but in blue instead of green
or red. In addition, the FPS, total population size, number of Vehicles that
have died, and largest population so far grown are all shown as text in the
canvas.

- Pause and Reset buttons: the pause button, halts the draw loop by calling
noLoop(). This is useful for looking at debug output since there is a lot of
data and it can be hard to see and slow to draw. The Reset Population button,
clears all the vehicles and the counts and begins from scratch, though the food
and poison arrays do not change.


Additional Changes

On February 20, 2020, I duplicated this project to really clean up the code and change the style

I began by moving constructor functions to ES6 classes and by changing all lets to vars where appropriate

I refactored the DNA to be in separate objects along with the genes. To be honest I think this could be done a better way
but the named constants are at least an improvement over indices into an array.

I also made the vehicles robust against new genes, so if you add genes (correctly by following the instructions in the comments)
loading vehicles from old save files will still work and the vehicles will just get a (reasonable) random gene value
for any genes they have not been assigned. Though it should be noted that all new genes should be added AT THE END OF THE
LIST because the list is ordered and adding one before the end will throw off the subsequent genes

I also made size and maxspeed variable based on genes but without breaking old save files (see above)

I added an Environmentals class to handle food and poison rendering and to enable them to be removed if they get too old. This
both prevents the build up of unnecessary food and poison and also helps to mitigate situations where food and poison are
too close together for the food to be usedful. This environmentals class was also necessary for another addition (the quadtree)
which I explain there

I also added a Quadtree. In fact, I added the exact implementation of Quadtrees from Coding Challenge 98 also by
Dan Shiffman of the Coding Train. I made a small change to that challenge. Instead of making use of the
userData property of the point class (the original class which is supposed to work with the Quadtree), I simply
added an x and y property (with getter and setter) to my vehicle and environmental class thus allowing them to
be directly inserted into the quadtree (rather than having them contained in a Point object). This vastly simplifies
the addition of a quadtree because it eliminates the need to keep the (x, y) of the Point class in sync with the
(x, y) of each vehicle. Every item (vehicle and environmental) is put into the quadtree and a type check is done
after querying the tree to find the correct objects. Furthermore, when a vehicle encounters an environmental,
it "consumes" it causing it to be removed, thus only one vehicle can eat a piece of food (or poison) rather than letting
many vehicles pass and consume it each frame. This was originally done by removing the food/poison from the array,
but now that the Environmental class exists, it keeps track of if the food/poison is "in play" so to speak. This is
needed because the Environmental objects in the Quadtree cannot be easily removed, but they can be easily invalidated
so that the next vehicle in the update loop that encounters it knows it cannot be eaten. This is perhaps a little hacky,
but it does work. Then, before the next frame, all dead vehicles and invalid/expired Environmentals are pruned from the
array. When the quadtree is rebuilt the next frame from the arrays, the invalid environmentals and dead vehicles are no longer present
